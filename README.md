# maze-game
The final goal is supposed to be a maze game where the user solves as many mazes as they can under 2 minutes to get on the leaderboard.

Currently the project is only capable of generating the random maze. 

The next steps are:
1) Making a solver to verify solutions to the maze.
2) Creating a way for the user to play the game.
3) Making a leaderboard using mySQL.
4) Connect it to Azure Web App Services and MS Azure SQL.
